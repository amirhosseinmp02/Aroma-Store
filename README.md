# Aroma Store
A complete persian store website written in .NET Framewrok based on Clean architecture . 
The Database structure is code-first(ef core) for now , so you can easy with just Update-Database command in Nuget-PackageManager create your own database . I removed appsettings.json for security reasons , so you should create one and put the settings like connection string , log information , google recaptcha and ... in it .

You can see all of the store possibilities with checking the aroma-store.ir . I will add a lot of possibilities and boost the code performance for futures !
